## Division & Position Management Service Requirements

### 1. Relationship between Divisions and Positions

Positions exist within Divisions in a hierarchical structure. According to the TDD, Positions are always associated with a specific Division, as indicated by the database schema where Positions have a foreign key (DivisionID) referencing the Division they belong to. This is a many-to-one relationship - each Position belongs to one Division, while a Division can have multiple Positions.

### 2. Hierarchical Structure for Divisions and Positions

The hierarchical structure appears to be relatively straightforward. Divisions have a direct parent-child relationship structure. Positions also have a hierarchical reporting structure, as indicated by the "reportTo" field in the positions collection, which references another position. This creates a management chain where positions report to other positions, allowing for the representation of organizational hierarchies within each division.

### 3. Data Fields for Divisions and Positions

For Divisions:

- _id: ObjectId
- name: String
- code: String
- description: String
- manager: ObjectId (References an Employee who manages the division)
- status: String
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date
- createdBy: ObjectId
- updatedBy: ObjectId


For Positions:

- _id: ObjectId
- name: String
- code: String
- division: ObjectId (References which division this position belongs to)
- description: String
- responsibilities: [String] (Array of responsibility descriptions)
- reportTo: ObjectId (References another position this position reports to)
- status: String
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date
- createdBy: ObjectId
- updatedBy: ObjectId


### 4. Position Requirements and Qualification Management

The system needs to track requirements and qualifications for positions which would include:
- Educational requirements (degree level, field of study)
- Experience requirements (years of experience, specific domain expertise)
- Skills requirements (technical skills, soft skills)
- Certifications required
- Physical requirements (if applicable for operational roles)

This information would be particularly important for the HRD module, which handles employee recruitment, evaluation, and development.

### 5. Division KPI and Performance Metrics

The system should support KPIs and performance metrics for divisions that may include:
- Operational metrics (efficiency, productivity, quality)
- Financial metrics (revenue, cost, profit contribution)
- Customer-related metrics (satisfaction, complaints resolution)
- Employee-related metrics (turnover rate, satisfaction)
- Division-specific goals and targets
- Performance against targets

These metrics would be visible on dashboards for management review.

### 6. Position Salary Grade and Benefit Package Configuration

For salary grade and benefit package configuration, the system needs to manage:
- Salary bands/ranges for each position
- Basic salary structure
- Allowances applicable to the position (transport, housing, etc.)
- Bonus eligibility and structure
- Benefits package (health insurance, pension, etc.)
- Overtime eligibility and rates
- Special compensation rules for specific positions

This information is critical for the HR module's payroll and compensation management.

### 7. Organizational Change History Tracking

The system should track:
- Creation of new divisions/positions
- Modifications to existing divisions/positions
- Changes in reporting relationships
- Position transfers between divisions
- Status changes (active/inactive)
- Management changes
- Restructuring events

Each change should record the timestamp and the user who made the change, which is facilitated by the createdBy, updatedBy, createdAt, and updatedAt fields in the schemas.

### 8. Integration with Existing Core-Service Models

The Division & Position Management Service needs to integrate with several existing models in the core service:
- Users model (for authentication and authorization)
- Employees model (which references positions)
- Branches model (as divisions and positions may be specific to branches)

The system architecture follows a microservice approach with RESTful APIs, so the Division & Position Management Service will need to communicate with these models through the API Gateway.

### 9. Integration with API Gateway and Auth Service

The Division & Position Management Service will integrate with:
- API Gateway: All requests to the service will pass through the API Gateway, which handles routing, rate limiting, and potentially caching.
- Auth Service: For authentication validation and authorization checks based on the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

This integration ensures that only authorized users with appropriate permissions can access or modify division and position data.

### 10. Validation Rules for Divisions and Positions

Key validation rules include:
- Division codes must be unique across the system
- Position codes must be unique across the system
- A position must be associated with a valid division
- If a position has a reportTo field, it must reference a valid existing position
- Division and position status must be one of the predefined values (active, inactive, etc.)
- Required fields validation (name, code, etc.)
- When a division is deactivated, all associated positions should be properly handled
- Prevent circular reporting relationships in the position hierarchy

Based on this comprehensive analysis, I can now implement a suitable Division & Position Management Service that aligns with your business requirements and technical specifications.
