# Frontend Architecture

## Overview

The Samudra Paket ERP frontend is built following a modern, scalable architecture that adheres to the project requirements and best practices. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and patterns implemented in the frontend.

## Architectural Patterns

### Atomic Design Methodology

The frontend follows the Atomic Design methodology, organizing components into a hierarchical structure:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Typography, Icon, Badge)
2. **Molecules**: Simple component groups (FormField, Card, Modal, Dropdown)
3. **Organisms**: Complex components (Header, Sidebar, Footer, DataTable)
4. **Templates**: Page layouts (DashboardLayout, AuthLayout)
5. **Pages**: Complete page implementations (HomePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage)

This approach ensures:
- Consistent UI across the application
- Reusable components
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Clear component responsibilities

### State Management Strategy

The state management follows a hybrid approach:

1. **Global State**: Redux Toolkit for application-wide state
   - Auth state (user, tokens, authentication status)
   - UI state (theme, notifications, sidebar state)
   - Entity data (shipments, customers, etc.)

2. **Server State**: React Query for API data
   - Data fetching, caching, and synchronization
   - Optimistic updates
   - Background refetching
   - Error handling

3. **Local State**: React's useState/useReducer for component-specific state
   - Form state
   - UI interactions
   - Component-specific data

### Hexagonal Architecture Adaptation

While traditional hexagonal architecture is more common in backend systems, we've adapted its principles for the frontend:

1. **API Layer**: API clients and service adapters
   - RTK Query endpoints
   - API utilities for error handling

2. **Application Layer**: Business logic and use cases
   - Custom hooks for domain logic
   - Redux slices for state management

3. **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and logic
   - Entity models and validation schemas
   - Business rules and constraints

4. **Infrastructure Layer**: External dependencies and adapters
   - UI components
   - Third-party integrations
   - Browser APIs

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

Each component follows a consistent structure:

```jsx
/**
 * ComponentName Component
 * Brief description of the component's purpose
 */

import React from 'react';
// Imports...

const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2, ...props }) => {
  // Component implementation
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

### State Management Implementation

1. **Redux Store**:
   - Organized by feature slices
   - Normalized state shape
   - Middleware for side effects
   - Selectors for data access

2. **React Query**:
   - API endpoints organized by domain
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Optimistic updates
   - Error handling

### Routing Strategy

The routing follows Next.js App Router conventions:

1. **File-based Routing**:
   - `/app/page.js` → Home page
   - `/app/dashboard/page.js` → Dashboard page
   - `/app/auth/login/page.js` → Login page

2. **Route Protection**:
   - Higher-order component (withAuth) for protected routes
   - Role-based access control
   - Authentication state checks

### Styling Approach

The styling follows Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach:

1. **Utility-first CSS**:
   - Consistent spacing, typography, and colors
   - Responsive design with breakpoints
   - Component-specific styles

2. **Theme Support**:
   - Light and dark mode
   - Customizable color palette
   - Consistent design tokens

### Error Handling Strategy

Comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

1. **API Errors**:
   - Standardized error responses
   - Error boundaries for component failures
   - User-friendly error messages

2. **Form Validation**:
   - Client-side validation with Zod
   - Field-level error messages
   - Form-level error handling

3. **Application Errors**:
   - Global error boundary
   - Error logging
   - Fallback UI

## Design Decisions

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

All components are designed with a mobile-first approach:

1. Start with mobile layout and progressively enhance for larger screens
2. Use Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
3. Test on various screen sizes and devices

### Accessibility Compliance

The frontend is designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance:

1. Semantic HTML structure
2. Proper ARIA attributes
3. Keyboard navigation support
4. Sufficient color contrast
5. Screen reader compatibility

### Performance Optimization

Several strategies are implemented for optimal performance:

1. Code splitting and lazy loading
2. Memoization of expensive calculations
3. Optimized rendering with React.memo
4. Efficient state updates
5. API response caching

## Future Enhancements

1. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
2. **Progressive Web App**: Offline capabilities and installable experience
3. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking and performance monitoring
4. **A/B Testing**: Feature experimentation framework
5. **Micro-Frontend Architecture**: For larger scale and team collaboration

## Conclusion

The frontend architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and performant application. By following established patterns and best practices, the codebase remains consistent and easy to extend as new features are added.
