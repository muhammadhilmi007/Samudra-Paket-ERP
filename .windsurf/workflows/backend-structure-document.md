# Backend Structure Document Workflow

This workflow guides you through understanding and implementing the backend architecture of the Samudra Paket ERP system, focusing on microservices, API design, and data flow.

## Steps to Follow

1. Review the microservice architecture organization:
   - Authentication Service (user management, authentication, authorization)
   - Core Service (customer, package, shipment management)
   - Operations Service (pickup, delivery, routing)
   - Finance Service (invoicing, payments, accounting)
   - Notification Service (emails, SMS, push notifications)
   - Reporting Service (analytics, reports, dashboards)

2. Implement hexagonal architecture for each microservice:
   - API Layer: controllers, routes, middlewares, validators
   - Application Layer: use-cases, services, DTOs
   - Domain Layer: models, entities, value objects, events
   - Infrastructure Layer: repositories, database, external services

3. Follow the standardized folder structure:
   ```
   /service-name
     /src
       /api              # API Layer
       /application      # Application Layer
       /domain           # Domain Layer
       /infrastructure   # Infrastructure Layer
       /config           # Configuration
       /utils            # Utilities
     package.json
     server.js
   ```

4. Implement the API Gateway with:
   - Request routing to appropriate microservices
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh token mechanism
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

5. Set up MongoDB databases with:
   - Separate database namespace for each service
   - Proper schema validation with Mongoose
   - Indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Connection pooling for efficiency
