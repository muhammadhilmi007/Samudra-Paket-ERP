# System Prompts Document Workflow

This workflow guides you through understanding and using the system prompts for AI assistance in the development of the Samudra Paket ERP system, focusing on leveraging AI for code generation, problem-solving, and documentation.

## Steps to Follow

1. Review the system architecture prompts:
   - Apply Separation of Concerns & Domain-Driven Design
   - Follow Hexagonal Architecture principles
   - Implement API Gateway for frontend-backend communication
   - Use Event-Driven Architecture for microservice communication
   - Focus on scalability and maintainability

2. Understand the frontend development prompts:
   - Stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
   - Global state: Redux Toolkit
   - Server state: React Query
   - Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
   - Component structure: Atomic Design
   - Ensure responsive, mobile-first, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessible UI

3. Study the mobile development prompts:
   - Stack: React Native + Expo + TypeScript
   - Offline-first: WatermelonDB
   - Global state: Redux Toolkit
   - Integrate device features: Camera, GPS, Signature
   - Optimize for battery and data usage
   - Support both online and offline operations

4. Examine the backend development prompts:
   - Stack: Node.js + Express.js
   - Architecture: Hexagonal (API, App, Domain, Infra)
   - Database: MongoDB + Mongoose
   - Use Redis for caching
   - Use JWT for authentication
   - Use RBAC for authorization
   - Follow RESTful API principles

5. Understand the DevOps & CI/CD prompts:
   - Use Docker for containerization
   - Deploy via Railway.com
   - Automate CI/CD using GitHub Actions
   - Host DB on MongoDB Atlas
   - Implement monitoring, logging, backup, and disaster recovery
   - Optimize for cost-efficiency, security, and scalability
