# Application Flow Document Workflow

This workflow guides you through understanding the application flow of the Samudra Paket ERP system, including user journeys, business processes, and module interactions.

## Steps to Follow

1. Review the core user flows to understand the main user journeys:
   - Authentication Flow (JWT-based with refresh token mechanism)
   - Pickup Management Flow (request, assignment, tracking, documentation)
   - Shipment Processing Flow (measurement, pricing, sorting, loading)
   - Delivery Management Flow (routing, POD, COD collection)
   - Return Management Flow (reason documentation, processing)
   - Financial Operations Flow (invoicing, payment processing, reconciliation)

2. Examine the state transitions for each flow:
   - Follow the defined state diagrams without skipping states
   - Ensure proper validation at each step
   - Implement error handling for every critical step

3. Study the module interaction patterns:
   - Web application modules communicate through defined service interfaces
   - Mobile application modules operate independently with proper synchronization
   - Cross-module operations maintain data consistency

4. Review the mobile application offline operation requirements:
   - Support offline data capture with WatermelonDB
   - Implement conflict resolution for data synchronization
   - Ensure proper error handling for connectivity issues

5. Understand the data flow requirements:
   - Frontend validation before submission
   - API Gateway authentication and rate limiting
   - Microservice input validation
   - Database transaction management
